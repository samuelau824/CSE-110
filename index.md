# Personal Introduction
## Samuel Au
Welcome to my website!
I am currently a third-year student at UC San Diego studying Math-Computer Science. See [Myself as a Programmer](#myself-as-a-programmer).

Some of my **hobbies** include listening to music, playing video games with friends, and going on late night drives to release stress.

My favorite artist right now is Keshi, and one of his best songs in my opinion is ***always***.

My top three video games are:
1. Valorant
2. Teamfight Tactics
3. Overwatch

Another thing I like to do is watch informational videos on Youtube from creators such as Mark Rober. One of my favorite videos from him is one where he exposes [carnival scams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tk_ZlWJ3qJI).

One quote that I try to live by is:
> Be the best person that you can be today.

## Myself as a Programmer
I stumbled upon programming my freshman year of college, when I was a Biochemistry major who was taking a coding class simply for a General Education requirement. Little did I know, this would become a passion of mine and would convince me to switch majors. As I learned the intricacies of beginning coding class, I was amazed at the tiny projects I could create.

One of the coolest problems I solved was creating a function that turned Fahrenheit to Celsius when the user inputed a fahrenheit temperature. 
```
int fahrenheitToCelsisu(int fahrenheit){
    return ((fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9);
 }
 ```
As a programmer in CSE 110, my goals for this quarter are:
- Learn what it means to be a software engineer
- Refine my skills as a programmer
- Learn to work in a group environment
