# Personal Introduction
## Samuel Au
Welcome to my website!
I am currently a third-year student at UC San Diego studying Math-Computer Science. 
Some of my **hobbies** include listening to music, playing video games with friends, and going on late night drives to release stress.
>My favorite artist right now is Keshi, and one of his best songs in my opinion is ***always***.
## Myself as a Programmer
I stumbled upon programming my freshman year of college, when I was a Biochemistry major who was taking a coding class simply for a General Education requirement. Little did I know, this would become a passion of mine and would convince me to switch majors. As I learned the intricacies of beginning coding class, I was amazed at the tiny projects I could create.
One of the coolest tiny problems I solved was creating a function that turned Fahrenheit to Celsius when the user inputed a fahrenheit temperature. 
```
int fahrenheitToCelsisu(int fahrenheit){
    return ((fahrenheit -32) * 5/9);
 }
 ```
